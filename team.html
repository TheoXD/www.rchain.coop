                The RChain<sup>&reg;</sup> Cooperative was formed in January
                2017 to steward the development and progression of the RChain
                platform. The cooperative provides the foundational support

                  where users pay perhaps 25 cents to play a game of their
                  choice once, forever replacing the "freemium" garbage that has
                  become ubiquitious with a direct, independent distribution and
                  payment system that is clear, simple, and fair.
